Please submit all non-packaging issues (feature requests, etc.) to the upstream
bug tracker first (http://www.crbug.com).  Please also include a link to your
upstream report in the Debian bug submission to make it more straightforward to
keep track of issues.  Thank you!

If you experience crashes, please read this wiki page to get a useful backtrace:
http://wiki.debian.org/Chromium/Debugging

It's very helpful to include the output from chrome://gpu in your report, as a
lot of bugs can be specific to desktop environments and hardware.
