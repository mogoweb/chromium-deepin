  Version (or portions of such combination).
 .
  (c) the licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are
  effective on the date Contributor first makes Commercial Use of
  the Covered Code.
 .
  (d)    Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is
  granted: 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the
  Contributor Version; 2)  separate from the Contributor Version;
  3)  for infringements caused by: i) third party modifications of
  Contributor Version or ii)  the combination of Modifications made
  by that Contributor with other software  (except as part of the
  Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims
  infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by
  that Contributor.
 .
 3. Distribution Obligations.
 .
  3.1. Application of License.
  The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
  governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation
  Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be
  distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version
  of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a
  copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You
  distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code
  version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this
  License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include
  an additional document offering the additional rights described in
  Section 3.5.
 .
  3.2. Availability of Source Code.
  Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be
  made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License
  either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted
  Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
  Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
  Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
  months after the date it initially became available, or at least six
  (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification
  has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for
  ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the
  Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.
 .
  3.3. Description of Modifications.
  You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a
  file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and
  the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that
  the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original
  Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the
  Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
  Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the
  origin or ownership of the Covered Code.
 .
  3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
  (a) Third Party Claims.
  If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's
  intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights
  granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,
  Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code
  distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the
  party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will
  know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after
  the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,
  Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies
  Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps
  (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
  reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered
  Code that new knowledge has been obtained.
 .
  (b) Contributor APIs.
  If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming
  interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which
  are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must
  also include this information in the LEGAL file.
 .
  (c)    Representations.
  Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to
  Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's
  Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or
  Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by
  this License.
 .
  3.5. Required Notices.
  You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
  Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source
  Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a
  location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely
  to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s)
  You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in
  Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation
  for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership
  rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to
  charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
  obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You
  may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
  Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than
  any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
  offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
  Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
  Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
  support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
 .
  3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
  You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
  requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,
  and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of
  the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
  including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
  obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included
  in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or
  collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the
  Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered
  Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may
  contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
  compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
  Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's
  rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
  License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
  license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
  from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
  Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
  Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
  the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
  terms You offer.
 .
  3.7. Larger Works.
  You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code
  not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
  Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
  requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.
 .
 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
 .
 If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
 License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to
 statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
 the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
 describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description
 must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must
 be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
 extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
 sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
 understand it.
 .
 5. Application of this License.
 .
 This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
 attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.
 .
 6. Versions of the License.
 .
  6.1. New Versions.
  Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised
  and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version
  will be given a distinguishing version number.
 .
  6.2. Effect of New Versions.
  Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
  License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
  version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms
  of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one
  other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to
  Covered Code created under this License.
 .
  6.3. Derivative Works.
  If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may
  only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
  governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that
  the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape",
  "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your
  license (except to note that your license differs from this License)
  and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license
  contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and
  Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial
  Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in
  Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of
  this License.)
 .
 7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
 .
 COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
 WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
 WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF
 DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.
 THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE
 IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,
 YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE
 COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER
 OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF
 ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
 .
 8. TERMINATION.
 .
  8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
  automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
  such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
  sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall
  survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their
  nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
  shall survive.
 .
  8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement
  claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer
  or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom
  You file such action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:
 .
  (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
  infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such
  Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License
  shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,
  unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)
  agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable
  royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such
  Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to
  the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days
  of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not
  mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim
  is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under
  Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of
  the 60 day notice period specified above.
 .
  (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
  Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then
  any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)
  and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,
  sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that
  Participant.
 .
  8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
  alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or
  indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as
  by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
  infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
  granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
  into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
  license.
 .
  8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,
  all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)
  which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder
  prior to termination shall survive termination.
 .
 9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
 .
  UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
  (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL
  DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,
  OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR
  ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
  CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
  WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
  COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
  INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
  LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
  RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
  PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
  EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO
  THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
 .
 The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in
 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
 software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such
 terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48
 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),
 all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those
 rights set forth herein.
 .
 11. MISCELLANEOUS.
 .
 This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
 matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
 unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
 necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
 California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if
 any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.
 With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,
 or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United
 States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be
 subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern
 District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,
 California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including
 without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and
 expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on
 Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
 Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract
 shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this
 License.
 .
 12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
 .
 As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
 responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
 out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
 work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
 responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
 shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.
 .
 13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.
 .
 Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
 "Multiple-Licensed".  "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial
 Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under
 Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified
 by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.
 .

 3. Responsibilities
 -------------------
 .
 3.1. Distribution of Source Form
 .
 All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
 Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
 the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
 Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
 License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
 attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
 Form.
 .
 3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
 .
 If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
 .
 (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
     Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
     the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
     Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
     than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
 .
 (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
     License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
     license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
     the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
 .
 3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
 .
 You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
 provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
 the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
 Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
 Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
 License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
 under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
 the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
 Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
 License(s).
 .
 3.4. Notices
 .
 You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
 (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
 or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
 the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
 the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
 .
 3.5. Application of Additional Terms
 .
 You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
 indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
 Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
 behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
 such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
 You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
 liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
 indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
 disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
 jurisdiction.
 .
 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
 ---------------------------------------------------
 .
 If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
 License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
 statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
 the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
 describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
 be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
 Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
 or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
 recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
 .
 5. Termination
 --------------
 .
 5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
 if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
 compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
 Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
 Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
 ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
 non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
 come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
 Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
 notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
 first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
 from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
 Your receipt of the notice.
 .
 5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
 infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
 counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
 directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
 You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
 2.1 of this License shall terminate.
 .
 5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
 end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
 have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
 prior to termination shall survive termination.
